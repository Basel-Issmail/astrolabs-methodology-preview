                            with our own proven frcmework to provide a customized and effective learning experience.

                        <p class="methodology-block__paragraph">When designing custom programs, we begin by asking what
                            the participants and their organization is aiming to achieve after the program ends. This
                            approach enables us to deliver efficient, impact-focused programs that our busy participants
                            will appreciate, eliminating elements of traditional training that do not add measurable
                            value.

                        <p class="methodology-block__paragraph">Our team then begins assembling the program modules as
                            building blocks meant to achieve the team's defined impact goals. Balancing between offering
                            a challenging environment and the capability of a group to learn new skills and behaviors,
                            the program modules vary in size and intensity keeping the energy of the participants in
                            mind. We always include case studies and practical hands-on exercises to drive home key
                            lessons and make them even more relevant.

                <p class="methodology-block__paragraph">After developing a program, we go back to the drawing board and
                    ask, "Does this content resonate with real world experience, and will participants be able to
                    connect the lessons to their everyday lives?". Subsequently, we may enrich the content with more
                    case studies and practical hands-on exercises to drive home some key lessons and make them even more
                    relevant. </p>

                <p class="methodology-block__paragraph">Before each program we try to understand where our participants
                    are coming from, strengths and any special needs. We review profiles and build an initial
                    understanding of the cohort. We conduct pre-program surveys or interviews to dive deeper into their
                    perspectives, gaps and what they want to get out of the program.

                <p class="methodology-block__paragraph">Since all of our instructors are practitioners themselves, they
                    are agile enough to adjust the materials and exercises based on the interactions that naturally
                    emanate from the discussions during the course. Although we always do a significant amount of
                    preparatory work before the program starts, maintaining this kind of flexibility to address the
                    components the group would like to discuss most keeps our programs uniquely dynamic.
